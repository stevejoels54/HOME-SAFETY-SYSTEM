# HOME-SAFETY-SYSTEM
Home safety system is a remote gas leak detection system and smart fire detector.

What problem/need are we trying to solve?
Delay in fire detection that leads to loss of lives and destruction of property.
Gas related accidents and fires, dangerous build up of carbon monoxide.

What is my solution:
The device I have designed is a fully IoT enabled with an MQ2 sensor that detects
smoke, carbon monoxide and LPG it also has a TMP36 temperature sensor as well
as a LORA module that sends sensor readings to the gateway which forwards the
sensor readings to the cloud and later a web dashboard displays the sensor
readings to allow remote sensing and remote alarming/notification incase of a fire
detection, carbon monoxide levels increase and LPG gas leakage.

The device also has a character LCD screen that allows real-time display of real
time room temperature, LPG(gas used to cook at home) and carbon monoxide
levels for safety monitoring and awareness.
